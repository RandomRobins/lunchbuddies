An app for creating semi-random pairings

I grew up in West Seattle and have lived most of my life in the greater Seattle area. With a Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry from the University of Washington, most of my professional experience has been in research. Over time I found that the favorite part of my work was scripting data analyses in R and other programming-related tasks, so making the transition into the tech industry seemed like a sound move to make.
