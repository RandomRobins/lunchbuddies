## Technologies Used

Lunch Buddies uses jQuery(utilizing MVC file structure), HTML and CSS(SMACSS file structure) and Handlebars (HTML templating) to create a single-page application on the client side, along with a reponsive, mobile-first UI.  We are using an API we created with Node.js to interact with a PostgresSQL database on our backend, deployed via Heroku, and planned/implemented over a weeklong dash.

I grew up in West Seattle and have lived most of my life in the greater Seattle area. With a Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry from the University of Washington, most of my professional experience has been in research. Over time I found that the favorite part of my work was scripting data analyses in R and other programming-related tasks, so making the transition into the tech industry seemed like a sound move to make.

I've done much with my 35 years of life so far, including but not limited to: a dance instructor, a Navy Air Traffic Controller, a banker for a number of banks, a pest control technician, and most recently a boxing coach and instructor.  Through my vast experiences, I've learned that I attract to occupations that include a nice mix of math, problem solving, and helping others.  Which is why I'm now pursuing a career in software development.  I'm thankful to Apprenti for giving me a chance to walk this path, a chance I doubt I would've gotten without them.
