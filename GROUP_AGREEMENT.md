# Random Robins - Group Agreement

## Communications Plan
* ### Our planned group culture objectives:
  * We will strive not to cut other off.
  * No disparaging or abusive language.
  * We will all work to create an environment where everyone feels safe to speak their mind and give their opinions.
  * We will use Slack to communicate while out of class.

## Conflict Plan
  * We're a group with an odd number of people, so we will attempt to resolve issues by a simple vote.

## Work Plan
  * We plan to do the bulk of our back-end work via mob-programming.
  * For the front-end work and other tasks like css styling we will break off tasks and tackle them independently or as a pair.

## Git Process
  * No merging your own pull requests.
  * We will set issues for every task.
  * We will perform group merge-parties a few times a day.
