# User Scenarios


## Julie - VP of Community Engagement

Julie works for WTIA, a non-profit organization that serves as a unifying voice for the technological community in Washington.  Given the broad mission standup, it's difficult for any single employee to see the bigger picture for the organization as a whole.  She wants a way to build more bridges and connections within the company.

## Tracey - TA at Code Fellows

Tracey would like to help her students work together to better prepare them for corporate settings where team work is important.  She is already assigning them in pairs on a daily basis by hand, but her system breaks easily whenever some students go absent.  If only there was a system of automation.

## Bob - Debate Tournament Director

Bob is a tournament director who follows the Swiss-style system.  To ensure fairness, he wants to focus on random pairings for early rounds, rather than starting with a bracket system right off the bat.

# Noah - News Anchor

Noah is building an arc, with enough room for two of every animals.  Since he doesn't want to play God, he needs a system that can help him decide which pairs to include.
