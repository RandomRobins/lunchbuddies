# Lunch Buddies - MVP

## MVP
* As the VP of Community Engagement Julie would like an application that helps her to match her employees for lunches to ensure everyone gets an opportunity to meet each other.
* Julie also wants to track who has met with who to ensure that everyone has a chance to meet each other.
* As someone who wants to ensure the genetic diversity within his zoo, Noah would like to be able to match potential mates who have not interacted with each other before.
* Julie would like the ability to incorporate pre-existing pairing data to avoid unnecessary repeats.
* Julie wants a simple interface to enter and remove employees as they join or leave her company.
* As a TA for Code Fellows, Tracy would like a better system for creating pair-programming partners in classes that she is working with.
* Tracey would like the pair-making to be semi-automated to save her time in performing this task.
* As a tournament director, Bob would like an application for pairing off competitors.
* Being a busy TA, Tracey would love for the application to persistently store form input, in case she needs to put aside her pair making and come back to it later.

## Stretch Goals
* As an added convenience, Tracey would like to be able to pull partner pairing output in a fashion that makes it easy to post the pairs in applications like Slack.
* Even when everyone has had a chance to group with each other, Tracey would like the application to continue to create new pairs that minimize overlap with previous pairings.
* Julie would like her application to allow users to enter food preferences so that it can make restaurant suggestions for the pairs for their lunch meetings.
* Bob would like the ability to establish sub-groups (exclusion groups) so he could continue to automate random pairings after each competition round.
* Being responsible for establishing pairings, Bob would like to implement a Swiss-system tournament.
